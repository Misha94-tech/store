# Responsive Store Landing Page

## Design Description:

This landing page was designed using Bootstrap 5 for quick responsiveness and clean layout. The header includes a collapsible navigation menu that adapts for mobile devices. The product section uses a responsive grid system showing 3 product cards with images, descriptions, and call-to-action buttons. The footer mirrors the header with navigation links.

**Design choices:**

- Used Bootstrap's grid and navbar components to simplify responsiveness.
- Product cards have shadows and hover effects for modern look.
- Buttons are full width on all devices for ease of use.
- Color scheme is neutral with dark header/footer and white product cards to maintain clarity and focus.
- Media queries are handled mostly by Bootstrapâ€™s responsive classes, ensuring great display across all screen sizes.
